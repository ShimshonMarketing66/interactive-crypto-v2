                The username and password are used to ensure that only you have access to any of the personal information
                you have provided. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of any password you use to register,
                and you should always be careful whenever disclosing information online.

            <li>
                In addition, we receive and store any information you enter on our Site or give us in any other way. This includes information
                that can identify you (“personal information”). The amount of personally identifying information you provide
                is up to you, and you are not legally obligated to provide such information. However, your use of the Site
                or the Services may be curtailed if such information is not provided.
            </li>
            <li>You may provide information on behalf of another person or entity. If you completed the registration on behalf

                closed, to store user information to facilitate future sessions.</li>

                or to notify you when a cookie is being placed on your device. Each browser is different, but generally users
                can remove cookies by following directions provided in the browser’s “help” file. Please note that, if you
                reject cookies or disable cookies, some features of the Services may not function properly.
